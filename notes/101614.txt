things to improve:
1. how to make the plots wider?
2. how to make the scatterplot and contour plot faster? (thinning option?)

repo structure (3 repos):
1. communication repo (meeting notes, random functions, comments)
2. developer repo (containing a most up-to-date version of package)
3. public repo (containing a bug-free package that can be used by everyone)

next meeting: Tuesday 9:15 am 10th floor SSW
